# Flower Shop Website

This project represents my **floral design business**—a website built to showcase my custom floral arrangements and services. It serves as an online presence where potential clients can explore my work, learn more about my services, and contact me for event planning or custom bouquet orders. The site is interactive and designed to provide a seamless experience for anyone looking to transform their events or spaces with beautiful floral designs.

## About the Project

The **Flower Shop Website** was created to help potential customers learn about my business and book services. It features several key elements:

- **Home Page**: Introduces my floral design business and provides a brief overview of the services I offer. Visitors can find general information about my expertise, such as custom bouquets and park decorations.
  
- **Services**: Detailed descriptions of the services I offer, such as:
  - **Custom Bouquets**: Personalized flower arrangements for any occasion.
  - **Corporate Event Decorations**: Creating floral designs for offices, conferences, and corporate gatherings.
  - **Wedding and Special Event Designs**: Beautiful floral setups tailored to weddings, anniversaries, and private parties.
  - **Outdoor and Park Decorations**: Transforming parks, gardens, and outdoor venues with vibrant, seasonal flowers.

- **Gallery/Portfolio**: A collection of past floral designs and event setups that give visitors a visual idea of my work. This includes weddings, corporate events, and large-scale outdoor projects.

- **Bouquet Builder**: An interactive tool where visitors can design their own bouquet, selecting flowers and styles to create a personalized arrangement.

- **Contact Information**: A way for visitors to get in touch with me for inquiries, consultations, or booking services. 

- **Blog**: A space where I share floral tips, seasonal trends, DIY flower arrangement guides, and behind-the-scenes looks at how I design floral displays.

### Technologies Used

The project leverages several technologies to create a seamless, interactive user experience:

- **Frontend**:
  - **HTML5**: Structure of the website.
  - **CSS3**: Styling and layout. I used custom CSS to make sure the website fits my floral business' aesthetic—light, elegant, and clean.
  - **JavaScript**: For interactive features like the bouquet builder tool, which allows users to select different flowers and customize their bouquets.

- **Backend**:
  - **Node.js**: The server-side JavaScript runtime used to run the backend of the application.
  - **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework, used to handle routing and serve content.
  
- **Templating**:
  - **Pug**: A templating engine that helps render HTML dynamically from server-side data, making the website more dynamic and flexible.

- **Task Automation**:
  - **Gulp**: Task runner used for automating repetitive tasks such as compiling Pug templates, minifying JavaScript, and watching for changes during development.

- **Deployment**:
  - **GitHub Pages**: The site is deployed using GitHub Pages, which is a free hosting service for static websites directly from a GitHub repository.
